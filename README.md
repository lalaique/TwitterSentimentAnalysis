# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This rpoject aims to determine the efficacy of using Twitter data to analyse public sentiment toward the 2016 U.S. presidential can- didates via topic modelling, sentiment analysis and correlation analysis. The findings suggest that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling does not clearly categorise presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, nor can tweets be effectively grouped as positive or negative. The Na ̈ıve Bayes classifier technique was used to conduct sentiment analysis and hashtags were used to automatically label tweets as positive, negative or neutral. There was little correlation found be- tween tweet sentiment data and voting outcomes, suggesting that Twit- ter should be used cautiously as a basis for predicting the outcomes of elections.
